# Athletic_Movement_Detection
These are the source codes for the paper, "An unsupervised approach to detecting and isolating athletic movements", EMBC2016. Please visit [my webpage](http://terryum.io/publications/#EMBC2016) for more papers, slides, etc.

## Instruction

1. Download [Human-Robot Motion Simulator](https://github.com/terryum/Human-Robot-Motion-Simulator-based-on-Lie-Group) from my GitHub repo. 
2. Set path the downloaded folders (including subfolders): <br/>
  *Home - Set path - Add with subfolders - choose the downloaded folders*
3. Open the [Main_AthleticMovemetDetection.m](https://github.com/terryum/Athletic_Movement_Detection/blob/master/Main_AthleticMovemetDetection.m) file and run it (F5)
4. You can change the options (e.g. exercises, threshold value) as described in the comments in the main file.
